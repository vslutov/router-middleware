## :page_with_curl: Guidelines

Being an open-source contributor is awesome :bowtie: but with great awesomeness comes great responsibility; and the responsibility of what you might ask! Well, you certainly don't wanna make a PR that would break the codebase :x:, or instead of fixing bugs, creates more :beetle:. So, here are some curated guidelines one should follow while contributing :trophy:

-   Raise an issue regarding bug fixes or feature enhancements, before making a PR.

-   While raising an issue, please follow the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) guidelines.

-   First, claim an issue and make a PR only when you're assigned to it.

-   To claim an issue, just leave a comment and you'll be assigned on `first come, first serve` basis.

-   Organize your code adhered to [Standard style guide][1] as much as possible.

-   Configure your editor to support the preferences from the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file.

-   A feature enhancement PR should include corresponding unit tests.

-   Squash your commits for cleaner commit history.

-   While making a PR, please follow the [pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md) guidelines and mention the issue you are solving, like so - `Fixed #2`.

-   Your PR must pass the [Travis CI][2] checks for it to be considered getting merged.

-   Maintain a healthy environment and don't indulge in any kind of activities that's against the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
